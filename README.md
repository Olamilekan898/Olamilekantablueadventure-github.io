Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to leverage Tableau to create and build Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using calculated measures. The analysis focuses on comparing the current year's performance in terms of sales, profit, orders, and customers with their previous years' performance. This project aims to provide an easy and intuitive way to track and compare the company's performance over time, thereby aiding strategic decision-making.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Data World](https://data.world). The data includes various metrics related to sales, profits, orders, and customer demographics.

## Key Features and Visualizations

1. *KPIs with Calculated Measures:*
   - *Sales, Profit, Orders, and Customers:* KPIs are created to compare the current yearâ€™s performance with previous years. Adjacent to each KPI, an area bar chart shows quarterly performance, with minimum and maximum values labeled for clarity.

2. *Sales by Marital Status:*
   - A bar chart that breaks down sales by marital status, comparing sales among married and single individuals. This helps understand which demographic is purchasing more and can inform targeted marketing strategies.

3. *Geographical Analysis:*
   - A map chart displaying the number of customers and maximum sales by country and continent. This visualization helps identify regions with high sales and potential areas for market expansion.

4. *Top Customers by Orders:*
   - A combined bar chart showing the top 10 customers based on the number of orders. For instance, Mrs. Samantha Jenkins leads with 26 orders, generating total sales of $1,739.58. This helps identify and appreciate high-value customers.

5. *Dynamic Parameter Chart:*
   - A chart with parameters for quantity, profit, sales, and orders, allowing for dynamic comparison by region. Users can select different metrics to compare, such as profit by quantity sold based on gender.

6. *Top 10 Products by Sales:*
   - A visualization of the top 10 products by sales, with the "Mountain 200 Black, 46" product generating the highest sales at $1,241,735.51. This helps in understanding product performance over time.

7. *Sales by Product Categories:*
   - A pie chart showing the sum of sales by product categories. Accessories lead with $23,642,495 in sales, while clothing has the least with $365,418.62. This informs inventory and marketing strategies.

8. *Customer Income Categories by Profit Margin:*
   - A treemap visualizing profit margins by customer income categories, helping to identify which income groups generate the most profit and targeting them effectively.
